  Welcome!
</h1>

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) major with a minor in Computer Science, passionate about robotics, embedded systems, and control. My experience spans real-time systems, multi-threading, digital controllers, and embedded software development. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with ROS2, C++, Python, and Linux, integrating microcontrollers with sensors for robotics and aerospace applications. I specialize in hardware-software co-design, efficient data communication, and control strategies for dynamic systems. Currently, I'm leading electronics/software development for a NASA Student Launch payload and contributing to adaptive actuators for legged robots. Open to collaboration and always eager to learn new tech!
